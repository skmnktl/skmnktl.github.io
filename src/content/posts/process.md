# Coding Interview Process

This is an adaptation of Polya's problem solving process to the oddity of having to talk and think.

The goals of a coding interview are to produce code that is:
  - correct,
  - readable, and
  - efficient.


## Understand

+ Parse the Question
  - Inputs & Outputs
  - Examples
    - Positive
    - Negative
    - Edge Cases

## Plan

+ Identify appropriate Data Structures
  - Array, Linked List
  - Tree, Graph, Trie
  - HashSet, HashMap
+ Consider Strategies
  - DS
  - Time & Space Complexity
+ Write Pseudocode Framework
  - Working Solution > Optimal Solution w/o Code

## Write Code

+ Comment on each
  - scoped block: functions, loops, etc.
  - uncommon STL calls
  - alternatives to writing 


## Reflect

+ Code Style
+ Time & Space Complexity
+ Request Feedback
